# pdcalc
RPN scientific calculator<br>
<br>
My own personal calculator project, to include functions I find useful. For simplicity, it uses RPN and a stack.<br>
<br>
Planned features:<br>
<br>
Unlimited precision using the GMP library<br>
Support for decimal, binary, and hexadecimal number representations, interchangable within calculations<br>
Arithmetic functions<br>
Trig functions<br>
Boolean functions - AND, OR, NOT, XOR<br>
Time calculations<br>
<br>
and more as I decide.<br>
<br>
Project status: in development, pre-alpha.
