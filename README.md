# pdcalc
RPN scientific calculator

My own personal calculator project, to include functions I find useful. For simplicity, it uses RPN and a stack.

Planned features:

Unlimited precision using the GMP library
Support for decimal, binary, and hexadecimal number representations, interchangable within calculations
Arithmetic functions
Trig functions
Boolean functions - AND, OR, NOT, XOR
Time calculations

and more as I decide.
